Exercise 1 Name your file: MonthNames.py Write a program that reads an integer value between 1 and 12 from the user and prints output the corresponding month of the year. An example run of the program (numbers in bold are typed in by the user) Enter the month: 3 Month 3 is March Exercise 2 A certain cinema currently sells tickets for a full price of 6 pounds, but always sells tickets for half price to people who are less than 16 years old, and for a third of the price for people who are 60 years old or more. An example run of the program (numbers in bold are typed in by the user) Enter your age: 63 Your ticket costs £2.00 Exercise 3 Name your file: BodyMassIndex.py Write a program to calculate your BMI and give weight status. Body Mass Index (BMI) is an internationally used measurement to check if you are a healthy weight for your height.The metric BMI formula accepts weight in kilograms and height in meters: BMI= weight(kg)/height2(m2) BMI Weight Status Categories table BMI range - kg/m2 Category Below 18.5 Underweight 18.5 -24.9 Normal 25 - 29.9 Overweight 30 & Above Obese An example run of the program (numbers in bold are typed in by the user) Enter your weight in (kg): 75 Enter your height in (m): 1.70 Your BMI is: 25.95 You are in the “overweight” range. Exercise 4 Write a Python program to receive 3 numbers from the user and print the greatest among them. Exercise 5 Find the factorial of a given number using loops(note the number is received from the user) Exercise 6 Reverse a number using while loop Exercise 7 Finding the multiples of a number using loop Exercise 8 Write a program to print the inputted value as it is and break the loop if the value is 'done'. Example run of the program :hello there hello there :finished finished :done Done Exercise 9 Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 10. But for multiples of three print "Fizz" instead of the number and for the multiple of five print "Buzz". For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print "FizzBuzz" Exercise 10 Write a program to print the following pattern: 5 4 3 2 1 4 3 2 1 3 2 1 2 1 1

# 6_Python_Part_Assignment_OOPs

Question 1: (5 Marks) Build a program to manage a university's course catalog. You want to define a base class Course that has the following properties: course_code: a string representing the course code (e.g., "CS101") course_name: a string representing the course name (e.g., "Introduction to Computer Science") credit_hours: an integer representing the credit hours for the course (e.g., 3) You also want to define two subclasses CoreCourse and ElectiveCourse, which inherit from the Course class. CoreCourse should have an additional property required_for_major which is a boolean representing whether the course is required for a particular major. ElectiveCourse should have an additional property elective_type which is a string representing the type of elective (e.g., "general", "technical", "liberal arts"). Question 2: (5 Marks) Create a Python module named employee that contains a class Employee with attributes name, salary and methods get_name() and get_salary(). Write a program to use this module to create an object of the Employee class and display its name and salary.
